								<span>What is Adrenture?</span>
<p>->Adrenture is a self drive car rental service that provides you with all the privacy, 
fun and convenience of your own car, without the hassles of owning and maintaining one.
 We provide self drive car rentals for round-trips, outstation one-way, local one-way and weekly commute trips.
 We drop and pick-up cars from your doorstep, so that you can spend time on the more important thing - your drive! 
 The doorstep drop and pick-up of cars is our standard way of serving you, and is available throughout the areas served by us.</p>

								<span>Is there a "Kilometres limit" to how much I can drive?</span>
<p>->For round-trips and local one-way trips, it depends on the travelling day/days that you select.
 and you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you want. Adrenture it up! 
 You can still drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will attract an additional charge.</p>

 
								<span>Are there restrictions on where I can travel?</span>
<p>->All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit,
 so you are free to drive anywhere in the country.
 All India Tourist Permit means that the car is legally permitted to ply in any state in the country,
 after paying the inter-state taxes at the state borders.
 However, we do not permit taking Adrenture vehicles to Leh/Ladakh region and Kaza/Nako region.
 We also advise you to avoid bad terrains (especially in non- SUV cars) and areas affected by civil unrest.</p>

 
								<span>Do I have to bring the car back to the same location?</span>
<p>->No. You can choose different delivery and pickup locations within the same city,
 or even across cities (i.e., get a car delivered in one city, and have it picked up in another).
 However, this needs to be specified before the start of the booking at the time of booking confirmation/modification.</p>

 
								<span>Can I book a one-way trip?</span>
<p>->Yes, you can choose different delivery and pickup locations within the same city,
 or even across cities (i.e., get a car delivered in one city, and have it picked up in another).
 However, this needs to be specified before the start of the booking at the time of booking confirmation/modification.</p>

								<span>Can I book for any period of time?</span>
 <p>->There is no upper limit on the rental period (you can book your car for as long as you want).
 Also, for longer bookings, we can offer you mouth-watering deals.

								<span>What kind of cars can I choose from?</span>
<p>->We have a curated selection of cars,
 which includes block-buster models across segments such as SUVs,hatchbacks and sedans.
 We are constantly increasing our portfolio;
 so keep a close watch for your favourite car, just in case we don’t have it already.</p>
 

								<span>In the event of an accident or damage to the vehicle, what is my maximum liability?</span>
<p>->In the event of damages,
 your liability is limited to a maximum of Rs 10000.
 You will need to pay Damage Fee equivalent to the repair cost 
 (as estimated by an authorized dealership) and downtime losses, upto a maximum of Rs 10000. 
 This is independent of the nature and terms of the insurance cover that Adrenture has on the cars.</p>

	<p>Please note that the maximum liability policy is intended to benefit and protect the responsible user.
	In situations of irresponsible or unsafe or negligent usage, 
	there could be discretionary exceptions to this policy,
	whereby the user could be liable for all damages irrespective of whether or not Adrenture is able to claim insurance in such cases.</p>
	<br>-Examples of such situation include, but are not limited to:</br>

   <br> *When the User is not in compliance with the laws and/or with terms of the Adrenture User Agreement.</br>
   <br> *When the User is found to be under the influence of alcohol/narcotics while driving.</br>  
    <br>*When the incident happened in a state for which the user had failed to pay the inter-state tax while entering the state.</br>
   <br> *When there is misrepresentation of information in the driving license and ID proof details shared by the user.</br>
   <br> *Where there is clear evidence of extremely rash and negligent driving on the user’s part.</br>

<p>->In cases where the estimated damage charges exceed the security deposit,
<br>* we will request the user to pay the same at the time of returning the car. 
 In cases of non-payment, Adrenture reserves the right of legal action, 
 reporting to credit bureau and reporting to other authorities or persons,
 irrespective of their direct relevance to the case.</br>

<br>*In cases of accident, fare for the unused hours will not be refunded.</br>

<br>*Adrenture typically avoids charging for very minor damages (e.g., minor scratches and dents), 
and covers the vast majority of damage incidents under the maximum liability policy.</br>

<br>*In cases of collision or User failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by the User.
 In cases of vehicle failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by us</br>.</p>

								<span>Is Adrenture 24/7?</span>
<p>->Yes, we are accessible 24x7. But as of now, we don’t allow bookings starting or ending between 12 midnight and 4 am.</p>

								<span>Can I take a pet along with me?</span>
<p>->While we love pets, some of our customers might be allergic to them so we can’t allow pets in cars.<p>

								<span>Is there any speed limit?</span>
<p>->125 Kms/Hr is the speed limit. Exceeding it will attract a penalty for over-speeding.
 In some states (e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR), some cars might be equipped with speed governors,
 which will automatically restrict the speed to 80Kms/Hr. This is as per government directives.<p>
